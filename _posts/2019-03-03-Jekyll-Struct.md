Hello everyone, I'm Comradeprozac, just some guy on the internet with
too much time on their hands and I'm here to talk to you guys about
something I did with that spare time:

Restructure DIYtranslation's repo of his translation of *Tensei Shoujo
no Rirekisho* to make use of a feature of GitHub: [GitHub Pages!](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)

While I'm going to let DIYTranslations make the decision to merge this
branch and modify the github settings to make use of Pages by themselves
I do hope that they doing it, maybe that way they'll see more traffic
to the translation and maybe that'll help them continue with it, because
I really like this Light Novel and want to see it continue.

I'm also doing it because, while I think using a GitHub repo to host a
translation is fine, I don't think the way DIYTranslations did it was
the best. For example, I personally like using Firefox Reading Mode to
read translations on my, and use it's read it later feature for when I
go out, and GitHub's Markdown parser doesn't seem to work with it, but
using Jekyll to does seem to work just fine.

Anyway, I hope this works and we continue to see more translations from
our friend, DIYTranlations.
